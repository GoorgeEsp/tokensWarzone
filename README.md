# tokensWarzone
Two players face off on a board in which the first player holds the white tokens (called O) and the second player the black tokens (called X). At the beginning of the game, the board is shown and a coin is drawn to decide who will start playing. From this moment and in turns, each player can move his pieces and eliminate those of his opponent. The tokens must move diagonally.
When one of the two players does not have any tokens on the board, the game will stop and dictate who is the winner.
